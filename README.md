 This Project is made with collaboration with my other 2 classmates in our 2nd semester.
My part in this Project is Designing Products page, and adding every product, and a buying page with in build simple calculator.
But its limited to that page only., after we click the buy button, it will be redirected to " offline " webpage, even when you are online.
That page is just a dino game which is displayed in chrome when you are offline.
I haven't uploaded this on github when I completed the project, because only one of the group member has to upload, and the person who
designed the homepage uploaded this project in his git hub.
Well, now as a requirement in my job application I'm uploading this in my github.
